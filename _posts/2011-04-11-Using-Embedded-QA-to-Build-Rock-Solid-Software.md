title: Using Embedded QA to Build Rock-Solid Software
speaker: Tom DuPont
---

### About the Topic: 
Without an automated means to collect errors from deployed applications, how can you know that your software is performing as expected? Embedded QA can be used to augment your own internal QA efforts, greatly increasing both the effectiveness of your testing and overall stability of your applications. As Jeff Atwood phrased it, "If you're waiting around for users to tell you about problems with your website or application, you're only seeing a tiny fraction of all the problems that are actually occurring... the proverbial "tip of the iceberg". This presentation will go over the value of Exception Driven Development, and the tools you need to gain the vision necessary to improve your applications today.
