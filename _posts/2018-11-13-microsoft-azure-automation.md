### Details
Microsoft Azure Automation (AA) provides the ability to automate frequent, time-consuming, and error-prone management tasks. This automation helps you focus on work that adds business value. By using a hybrid Runbook worker, you can unify management by orchestrating across on premise and cloud environments. See how AA helps with tasks and functions like inventory, change tracking, Desired State Configuration (DSC), update management, Python 2 packages, and much more.
