title: Testing Real Code with Mock Objects
speaker: Robert Hencke
---

### About the Topic: 
 Unit tests can be difficult to write for existing code. Often, code takes dependencies out on the file system, external servers and other resources in a way that makes it hard to write isolated tests that do not affect the state of the system. Mock objects allow you to simulate these dependencies in a way where you can focus on testing just the code you want to.
