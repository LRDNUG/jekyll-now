title: Async and Await - A synchronous approach to asynchronous problems
speaker: Mike Andrews
---

### About the Topic: 
Developing multi-threaded applications is no easy task. It requires a thorough understanding of the problem domain and planning to effectively create a multi-threaded application; and not everything can or should be "threaded."  However, with the new Async and Await features of the .NET Framework, that task has just become much simpler and the code easier to understand. It now allows writing code that looks and "feels" synchronous, which is easier to comprehend, but still runs asynchronously, all with the help of the compiler.  We will explore the new Async and Await features and find out when you should use them over conventional threading primitives and when they should be avoided; how they can help you develop responsive user interfaces and generally develop clearer, cleaner and more understandable multi-threaded code even if no user interface is involved.
