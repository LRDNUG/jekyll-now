### Details

This session brings writing better code to the next level. Do you enjoy receiving bug tickets from QA? I didn’t think you would, so this session will provide solid practices that I have been using for most of my programming career to check-in to source only rock-solid code. You will learn my #1 mantra, along with over 13 rules, that I use while writing code that allows me to write new code (features) and stay out of maintenance mode hell.
