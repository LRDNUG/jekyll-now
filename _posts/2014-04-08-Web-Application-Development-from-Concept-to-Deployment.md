### About the Topic: 
Join us as we walk through each of the steps in designing and developing the ASP.NET MVC e-commerce site DesignerHipster.com, which is currently hosted in Windows Azure. We will discuss: · Design concepts for the site (from storyboard to html/css & database design) · Agile concepts used in development (keep it simple with iterative processes) · MVC project organization · Integrating with PayPal · Deploying website and database to Azure · Using Google Analytics to monitor site activity · Using Google AdWords to promote the site · Experiences along the way… DesignerHipster.com was a concept I've had for some time and was looking for an opportunity to build it. After learning about Azure and wanting to try it out, I decided it would be a good platform for hosting Designer Hipster. It’s rare that I get to build a site completely from scratch and I was surprised at how seemingly simple things held up my development. After working through a variety of issues, I’m excited to say the site is complete and is in production and I've got some really interesting experiences to share.
