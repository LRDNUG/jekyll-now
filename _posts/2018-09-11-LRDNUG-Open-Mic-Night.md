### Details
Join us Tuesday, September 11th for Little Rock .NET User Group's "Open Mic Night".

We're opening the floor to give you a chance to grab the mic for 10 minutes. This is your opportunity to share a cool thing you're using, discuss a hard problem you're looking for help solving, or tell a crazy story of triumph or woe you've experienced as a developer.

Pizza, soda, and water will be provided. We'll end the meeting with a prize raffle, courtesy of our generous sponsors.
