### About the Topic: 
With over 500 million active users, a Facebook presence is becoming actively pursued by companies everywhere, with many desiring custom application development to differentiate their brand above the rest. Let’s dive into Facebook development using ASP.NET MVC 3. We’ll create a simple tab application with a default view for all visitors and a custom view for people who have liked our Facebook profile. We’ll also setup a simple authorization scenario using Facebook OAuth to only allow authorized users into our full application. Using the Facebook JavaScript SDK, we’ll cover how to share content to a user’s wall using the Feed dialog.
