speaker: Matt Shull

### About the Topic: 
Performance is an ever growing topic among design and development communities. Everyone is striving to create a UX/UI that's both fast and user friendly. However, with page sizes growing each year, how can we ensure that our projects are at peek performance for our users? In this presentation, we take an interactive look at how performance has been measured in the past, what performance measuring tools are available to us today, and dive into how we should measure UX and performance as we move forward in our ever growing field. We'll also look at how our project's UX and performance can be determined by some current and upcoming Javascript features.
