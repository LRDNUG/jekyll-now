title: Spicing up your Code with Curry
speaker: Michael Collins
---

### Details
All encounters must begin with an introduction. This introduction is not to a tool or a new code library.We are not going to discuss a particular language. I want to introduce you to the functional programming paradigm. Except, we will not be diving in head first. Instead we will focus on just a single technique that demonstrates the mindset of functional programming, Currying. This would be similar to just dipping your toes into the pool of functional programming. There will be a bit of history, a review of everyday code, some curry ,and hopefully you depart with a new way to approach programming tasks

### About the Speaker
I'm an Arkansas raised computer scientist currently applying my skills at Arkansas Children's Hospital. Specifically, data analytics and system integrations. As a programmer, I am a tinkerer. The pleasure of using a new technique, a new tool, adjusting a program, preforming a workflow analysis is entertaining.  I have been attending the .NET user group meetings on and off again for years.
