### About the Topic: 
 Vision is the most powerful and efficient way to communicate information in a technological world. Approximately 70% of our sense receptors are dedicated to vision. Understanding how the brain processes this information is essential to the effective design of web pages, applications, graphics and infographics that tell a story and lead users through the journey we want them to take. We will briefly discuss the mechanics of sight, preattentive processing, limitations to perception and memory and Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception that will influence how we design for understanding and clarity.
