### About the Topic: 
This presentation will give developers an introduction to the Unity game engine. It will delve into both the editor and the engine's use of C# as a scripting language. A simple game called "Can Shooter" will be used to illustrate in the simplest terms possible how scripts work in Unity and what it takes to put together a game. Prior to the meeting, attendees are encouraged to download Unity from the website, [http://unity3d.com/unity/download/](http://unity3d.com/unity/download/). Joe will also be providing a link where the completed Can Shooter game and it's "source" may be downloaded so it's possible to follow along.
