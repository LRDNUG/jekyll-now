### About The topic
Add workflow capability to your application or web service by re-hosting Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). Create custom internal or external domain specific languages with a visual drag and drop interface. DSLs can be used behind the scenes or exposed to the user to create easily configurable tools.  In addition to DSLs, WF can be used to create state machines and flow charts visually for driving complex processes. Workflows can be easily modified in either Visual Studio or in a custom designer.  
Windows Workflow Foundation provides a declarative framework for building application and service logic and gives developers a higher level language for handling complex tasks. WF shares many aspects with Business Process Management but can be used outside of the business component tier in a hosting application. Application scenarios will be discussed to illustrate the flexibility and power of WF.
