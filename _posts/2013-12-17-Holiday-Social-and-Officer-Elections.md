### About the Topic: 
We hope you can join us for our annual officer election/holiday social, Tuesday December 17th at The Joint from 6:00pm to 7:00pm. This is an opportunity for you to cast your vote and join in the discussions to determine the direction of the user group for 2014. We will give away prizes throughout the evening and GDH is graciously providing Jimmy Johnâ€™s sandwiches. If you are interested in learning more about the officer positions or nominating yourself to help us next year, please see our [https://www.facebook.com/LRDNUG/posts/604286386286719](Facebook post on the subject). Please contact James or Daniel if you have any questions about the roles.
