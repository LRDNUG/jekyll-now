title: Game Development with XNA Studio (Part 3 of 3)
speaker: Richard Broyles
---

### About the Topic: 

Summer is here and the good folks at Little Rock .NET User's Group are making sure this one is a scorcher! Come out and get hands-on experience in .NET game development using Microsoft XNA Game Studio! Our very own Richard Broyles will be presenting a three-part series on XNA framework development, the same framework that can be used to develop games for Windows, Zune, and XBOX 360. Richard will go from game theory and basic mechanics, all the way up to a working end-product by the end of the third session. If you’ve ever been interested in video game development (…and you know you are) then this is the series for you. You do not want to miss three part series on game development right here in Little Rock, AR! Seating will be limited on a first come, first serve basis. So, bring a friend and get ready for what promises to be a fantastic night of food, fun, and game development good-ness! 

Part I - a brief introduction to video game history (not everyone knows this), introduction to the XNA framework, and how DirectX was involved. I will then move on to introducing the game design process, from the game design document to game psychology. After that, there will be probably the first break and then I will go on to introducing what game the group will help me write. The game will similar to the pong game that you did in Silverlight.

Part II - Interactive session!!! This session will be interactive as people from the audience will help me write the code for the game. I will introduce what happens when a XNA project is created in VS 2008 (I will NOT be using VS 2010), what files are created for you, what assemblies are used (Microsoft.Xna.Framework, etc.) as well some basic coding ideas for writing the game. (Hint: Generics will have a big part of the project, so it will be helpful to know something about generic types).

Part III - Interactive session continued!!! Whatever did not get done in the last session will be done here. I will also go over the future of XNA (i.e. XNA Game Studio 4.0) and how the audience can publish the games on the XBOX Live Marketplace and get paid for it. I will give a preview for designing games for Windows Phone 7 using the CTP preview of XNA Game Studio 4.0 (I will use VS 2010 here). After that, I will take questions from the audience about game design process and how people can get involved in the game industry (a $30 billion/year industry).
