speaker: Michael Johnson

### About the Topic: 
Using JavaScript to code complex and reactive user interfaces can be challenging. jQuery is great, but even when utilizing jQuery the code starts piling up. This is where KnockoutJS shines with its declarative binding. You get real time UI updates based on changes to an underlying data model with minimal code. We will walk through applying KnockoutJS to a complex real world application in ASP.NET MVC.
