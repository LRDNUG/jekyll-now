### About The topic
We will quickly cover the two fundamental categories of Search Engine Optimization; on-page and off-page. The focus will be diving in on the details of how use off-page SEO to drive Google rankings. Unit testing is a great way to help you improve your code.  It allows you to make changes or refactor your code to improve it with some confidence that your changes did not break things.  I am sure many of us realize the benefits of unit testing but find it difficult to do when working with a CMS or platform that you don't have full control over. This is the situation we will be discussing and I will show you how I have added unit tests to my customizations that are built on top of Umbraco. Umbraco is an open source content management platform built on top of ASP.NET, SQL Server, and AngularJS.  We will go over how to add a unit test to test your customizations for Umbraco as well as some insights I have gained from using unit tests in our Umbraco projects.
