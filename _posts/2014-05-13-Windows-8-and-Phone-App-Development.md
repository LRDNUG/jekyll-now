### About the Topic: 
This will be a hands-on lab to show you how to create a multi-platform app using the [XPlatformCloudKit framework](https://github.com/winappkits/XPlatformCloudKit). The XPlatformCloudKit was built by [Paul DeCarlo](http://pjdecarlo.com/) and the team behind [webappkits](http://github.com/winappkits). In this presentation, you will be shown how to build a Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone app which can retrieve data from any combination of RSS feeds, local XML files, or Azure mobile Services. This will be an interactive presentation demonstrating the power of the XPlatformCloudKit and how you might use a portable class library to build both a Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone app.
