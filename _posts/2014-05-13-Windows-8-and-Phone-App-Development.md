This will be a hands-on lab to show you how to create a multi-platform app using the [https://github.com/winappkits/XPlatformCloudKit](XPlatformCloudKit framework). The XPlatformCloudKit was built by [http://pjdecarlo.com/](Paul DeCarlo) and the team behind [http://github.com/winappkits](webappkits). In this presentation, you will be shown how to build a Windows 8 and Windows 8 Phone app which can retrieve data from any combination of RSS feeds, local XML files, or Azure mobile Services.
