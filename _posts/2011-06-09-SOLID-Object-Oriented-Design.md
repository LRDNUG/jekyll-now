### About the Topic: 
Are you interested in developing software that will be easy to maintain and extend over time? Do you work or have you worked on software that is difficult to maintain or extend? If you answered yes to either of these questions and are not familiar with SOLID then this presentation may just change your life, forever... SOLID is a set of design principles introduced by Robert Martin (or Uncle Bob as he known in the community) around the turn of the century. Used in concert, these principles provide the guidance necessary for creating software that will be maintainable, extensible, scalable, and many other 'ables.
