> Give me your tired, your poor coding issues,  
> Your huddled masses of error message, yearning to breath free,  
> The wretched refuse of your teeming client,  
> Send these, the broken code, tempest tost to me,  
> I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

Come get some help with your current ASP.NET project. A panel of our officers will address your questions regarding web development in ASP.NET. If needed, we'll walkthrough a short tutorial or two. The focus is to help solve your specific struggle developing your web app - whether that is a strategic issue, with a specific bug or figuring out how to use get with ASP.NET. Don't have a current project? That's okay too! Help us help others work through their issues or just come to learn how the pros work through problems.
