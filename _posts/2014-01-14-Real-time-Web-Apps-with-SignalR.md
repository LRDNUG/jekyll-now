title: Real-time Web Apps with SignalR
speaker: Kyle Neumeier

### About the Topic: 
Polling is so 2013! Come ring in the new year by learning how to build real-time web applications with SignalR. SignalR is an open-source, .Net library that makes it easy to write web applications where data is pushed from the server to the client by providing a high-level abstraction for doing RPC. It enables you to take advantage of HTML 5 websockets when it is available and to gracefully fall back to other transports/techniques when it is not not. Think real-time stock quotes, social-network status updates, chat rooms, multi-player online games, and collaborative editing. In this presentation, we will cover the SignalR library from a hands-on perspective, examining several applications that show-case various useful features. So this year, resolve to give up that old request-response model, and go full duplex communication instead!

### About the Speaker:
Kyle wakes each morning amazed that he is being paid for something he enjoys doing: developing software. He started stringing angle-brackets together in the correct sequence to produce web pages many years ago. Later he went to Fayetteville where they showed him how to use curly-braces and semicolons as well. Most of his professional career has been spent in java land, first writing software to make RFID readers talk, then developing software for an online brokerage (where he learned enough about the capital gains tax to make you cry). Recently, he has happily immigrated to the .Net world and works for CareEvolution -- a healthcare IT company based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He and his wife Genevieve live in Little Rock with their furry, four-legged friend Nutmeg.
