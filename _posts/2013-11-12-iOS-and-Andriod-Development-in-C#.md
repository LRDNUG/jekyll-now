### About the Topic: 
Have you ever wanted to develop apps for iPhone or Android, but can’t find room in your brain for objective-c or Java? Xamarin allows .NET developers to build native apps, while leveraging the C# language. During this presentation we’ll briefly discuss Xamarin as well as some of their products. We’ll also discover how to use Xamarin to share code across multiple platforms for rapid cross-platform mobile development. Please join me as we embark on a Xamtastic voyage!
