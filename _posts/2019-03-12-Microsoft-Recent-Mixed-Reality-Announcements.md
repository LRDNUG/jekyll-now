### About the Speaker
Starting as a Mixed Reality Developer in 2016, Jesse has built up a strong community around HoloLens and Immersive Headsets, and then joined Microsoft in 2018. This gives him a very unique perspective and a strong desire to advocate strongly for the developers who are supporting the platform.

He is often found hanging out in the HoloDevelopers Slack group, and on Twitter trying to keep up with everything going on in this rapidly growing space.
