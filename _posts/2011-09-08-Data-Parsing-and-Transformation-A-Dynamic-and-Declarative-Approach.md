title: Data Parsing and Transformation - A Dynamic and Declarative Approach
speaker: Mike Andrews
---

### About the Topic: 
We've all done it before - parse a file, transform it into a class or generic type for manipulation and then push it elsewhere: a database, a network stream, another file to be ingested by another program. These types of problems generally require one-off solutions with little reusability between projects. Despite having generic parsers for handling types of data like fixed-width, delimited, xml, etc, they do not provide a concrete definition of the data that you need to properly manipulate it. Weâ€™ll explore using dynamic and declarative development to create a hybrid approach that can be both generic and concrete, yet provide the speed and scalability that is needed to meet customer demands and help you develop solutions faster.
