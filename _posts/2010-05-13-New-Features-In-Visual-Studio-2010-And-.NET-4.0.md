### About the Topic: 

Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 have many new features which will save us time, speed up our programs, and generally increase our productivity. In this presentation we will go over a few of these new features which I find to be most interesting, and/or most productivity enhancing. Starting with some simple IDE enhancements, and ending with new easy to implement threading procedures. We will go over just some of the cool new features available to VS2010 .NET programmers.
