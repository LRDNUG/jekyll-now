title: Implementing Google Protocol Buffers in .NET
speaker: James Climer
---

### About the Topic: 
As you can probably imagine, inside Google massive amounts of data is passed around between a variety of disparate applications. Many of these applications were written in different languages and run on different platforms, but they must be capable of communicating quickly and efficiently with each other. In 2008, Google introduced Protocol Buffers (protobufs), a simple, extensible, platform independent serialization protocol which they now use as their lingua franca (vehicular language) between their applications. In this presentation we’ll learn about the protobuf standard, how to easily implement them in .NET and then we’ll watch a demonstration of an application using protobufs running circles around ones using Xml and Json.
