### About The topic
Come to the innovation hub and be heard. This month's meeting is focused on the members. The format will be open discussion. If you have an issue, or neat trick you have learned come and share it. The best way to learn a new technique or skill is to ask around and find individuals who have expertise with it. Come for the comradeship. Come for the refreshments. Come for the fun.
