### About the Topic: 
In two parts, we will explore the field of data mining. In part one, we will explore what data mining is and is not, and what the major algorithms can do in terms of prediction and description---for the benefit of science and business. In part two, we will explore one algorithm in detail, and see what it would take to implement a true custom data mining application.
