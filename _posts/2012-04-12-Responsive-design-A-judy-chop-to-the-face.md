title: Responsive design - A judy-chop to the face
speaker: David Hudson
---

### About the Topic: 
The web is changing and the devices we’re using to access the web vary greatly in size and capability. For designers AND developers, this is a problem. The old-school approach has been to create multiple versions of a site and maintain each one. This approach sucks. It’s time we recognized innovations like responsive design as a requirement instead of a passing fad. In this session, you’ll learn the basics of responsive design, how to be the office hero and, with a little luck, how to change the world forever. Call grandma and cancel tea time because you do not want to miss this!
