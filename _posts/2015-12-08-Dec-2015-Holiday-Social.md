Come join us for our annual Holiday Social and Officer Elections, Tuesday, December 8th at [The Innovation Hub](https://goo.gl/maps/hjdDB) from 6:00pm to 7:00pm. 

This is a great opportunity to cast your vote for officers and join in the discussions to **determine the direction of the user group for 2016**.  We will give away prizes throughout the evening and food will be provided. 

**If you are interested in being an officer for 2016** - you can read the positions and their responsibilities and put in your nomination: [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nKEYL1M95T2Mi3mOLP199rlTPCp1Wq4Z9YRZHfeWqVY/viewform).
