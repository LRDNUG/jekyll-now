  desc: |
    Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you will benefit from a data center and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organisations.
    An advantage of the AWS cloud is that it allows customers to scale and innovate, while maintaining a secure environment. Customers pay only for the services they use, meaning that you can have the security you need, but without the upfront expenses, and at a lower cost than in an on-premises environment.

    Register to attend our weekly online talks to explore cloud security and compliance topics and get your questions answered during live Q&A.
